### Processing
* Advanced image signal processor with computational video

### Graphics
* Many 15-inch MacBook Pro laptops have two graphics processors (GPU)â€”a discrete GPU and an integrated GPU. The discrete GPU provides substantial graphics performance but uses more energy. The integrated GPU optimizes battery life by using less energy.

### Storage
* The MacBook Pro has a huge amount of storage with the options of 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB.

### Memory
* The MacBook Pro is built with the Intel-based Processor. It has two memory sockets and can be upgraded to 2-8GBs maximum depending on your model.

# Conclusion
* From what we can see the MacBook Pro has way better specs since it's the newer PC.
